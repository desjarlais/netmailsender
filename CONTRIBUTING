CONTRIBUTING
We love pull requests from everyone.

GETTING STARTED
•	Make sure you have a GitHub account.
•	Fork the repository on GitHub.

MAKING CHANGES
•	Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
o	This is usually the master branch.
o	Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
o	To quickly create a topic branch based on master, run git checkout -b fix/master/my_contribution master. Please avoid working directly on the master branch.
•	Make commits of logical and atomic units.
•	Check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff --check before committing.

FORK, THEN CLONE THE REPO:
git clone git@github.com:your-username/mfcmapi.git

SUBMITTING CHANGES
•	Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.

PUSH TO YOUR FORK AND SUBMIT A PULL REQUEST.
At this point you're waiting on me.
