netmailsender
=============

NetMail Sender is a tool to help test the System.Net.Mail API.  It is basically an email sender and there are two goals I have for this tool. 

1. To provide a way to test sending mail using the System.Net.Mail API for troubleshooting purposes.
2. To provide sample code as an example of how you can possibly make use of the API.
